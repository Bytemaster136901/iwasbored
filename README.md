a random audio editor/music visualizer thingy I made for fun 😁👍
make sure your file is an audio file or video file. (mobile friendly)
please note that the pitch/frequency shifter right now is getting worked on, so you may experience some issues with them.
later on i might also add a videofile to audiofile or the other way onto the music waveform visualizer, so now have fun1!!!!111!!111!!
